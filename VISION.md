# Project Cathedral: The Vision
These mods are small steps in a grand design to create the definitive Minecraft automation experience, shaking the established scene with high-performance, physically grounded, and visually immersive systems.

## Drone Swarm Intelligence (GhostLib)
Drones are no longer just tools; they are the blood of the factory.
*   **Autonomous Logistics:** Swarms now live in **Drone Ports**, dispatching themselves based on demand and returning home to recharge.
*   **Industrial Scale:** Optimized spatial partitioning allows for thousands of concurrent jobs without performance degradation.

## Flux Power Ecosystem (VoltLink)
Energy is a tangible force, precomputed for zero-lag transmission.
*   **The Grid:** Cables and Poles create a physical lattice of power.
*   **Dynamic Supply:** Solar Panels and High-Capacity Batteries provide a balanced, reactive industrial power grid.

## The Cathedral Philosophy
Every system added must serve the larger goal of a cohesive, industrial-scale automation experience where performance meets high-fidelity UX. No instant magic — only physical machines and flying drones.
