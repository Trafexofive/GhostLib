# Technology & Drone Progression

This document outlines the planned progression path for Project Cathedral, moving from manual construction to autonomous orbital-scale engineering.

## 1. Tech Tiers

### Tier 0: The Manual Spark
*   **Focus:** Manual setup and small-scale building.
*   **Key Items:** Ghost Placer, Basic Drone (Player-owned).
*   **Power:** None (Drones use player spirit/cooldown).
*   **Capabilities:** Single block placement, 16-block search range.

### Tier 1: Industrial Foundation (Current Stage)
*   **Focus:** Fixed infrastructure and semi-autonomous construction.
*   **Key Items:** Drone Port, Electric Floor, Solar Panel, Battery.
*   **Power:** VoltLink Flux (Low Voltage).
*   **Capabilities:** 
    *   **Port-Owned Drones:** Drones fetch from containers.
    *   **Multiblocks:** 3x3 structures like the Electric Furnace and Drone Port.
    *   **Grid Sync:** Physical wires for power distribution.

### Tier 2: The Hive Mind (Planned)
*   **Focus:** Swarm coordination and specialized logistics.
*   **Key Items:** Hive Controller, Logistics Drone, Capacitor Upgrade.
*   **Power:** High-Voltage Flux (requires Transformers).
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Swarm Linking:** Multiple ports sharing a single job queue for massive builds.
    *   **Wireless Grid Tapping:** Drones recharge mid-air from poles.
    *   **Specialized Drones:** 
        *   *Heavy Lifter:* Moves entire 3x3 areas.
        *   *Fluid Drone:* Transfers liquids to construction sites.

### Tier 3: Orbital Command (Future)
*   **Focus:** Global-scale automation and satellite coordination.
*   **Key Items:** Satellite Link, Orbital Relay, Matter Fabricator.
*   **Power:** Fusion/Antimatter (Infinite-tier Flux).
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Orbital Scanning:** Blueprint whole biomes from a satellite view.
    *   **Matter Projection:** Physical ghosts are "fleshed out" by orbital lasers (high energy cost).

## 2. Drone Upgrade System

Upgrades are applied to **Drone Ports** or directly to **Drones** via the Upgrade Slot in the Port GUI.

| Upgrade | Effect | Tier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overclock Motor** | Increases flight speed by 50% | Tier 1 |
| **Precision Gripper** | Allows placement of delicate blocks (Glass, Redstone) | Tier 1 |
| **Flux Capacitor** | Drones can store 5x more energy | Tier 2 |
| **Wide-Band Antenna** | Increases job search radius to 128 blocks | Tier 2 |
| **Silk Touch Core** | Harvests any block without breaking it (e.g. Grass, Leaves) | Tier 2 |
| **Matter Compression** | Drone inventory increased from 9 to 27 slots | Tier 3 |

## 3. Ability Unlocks

As players progress through the tech tree, they unlock new **Construction Modifiers**:

1.  **Ghost Dragging (Unlocked at Start):** Ability to place lines and planes of ghosts.
2.  **Pattern Mirroring (Tier 1):** Flip blueprints across X/Z axes during placement.
3.  **Schematic Import (Tier 2):** Load `.nbt` or `.litematic` files into the Ghost Engine.
4.  **Auto-Repair (Tier 2):** Drones scan for damaged machinery and repair them using stored materials.
5.  **Biome Terraform (Tier 3):** Drones clear massive areas and level terrain to a specific Y-level.
6.  


- Copter Bot: order a Custom  copter bot to location, upon arrival it lowers a chain, auto attach to player and lift them to location (we still need to work on the engineer tablet for this to be possible) or switch to drone POV and fly there yourself. this ties into the whole orbital ideas where you can call down ships from orbit to pick you up and drop you off at locations, where depending on the satelite type (radar, compute (for drone and QOL progression), relays (FE, ...), military, space exploration , ...) we deploy and where (late game progression) give more range to bots, make bots smarter, global map (most operations from orbit, ordering jobs from orbit, ...) , 
- Ready For TitanFall???? Deploy Mechs to Space???
